MarathonEnvs + OpenAi.Baselines
-------------------------------


Experimental - using OpenAI baselines with MarathonEnvs (ML-Agents)


| Author: Joe Booth (@Sohojoe)
| Github repo: https://github.com/Sohojoe/MarathonEnvsBaselines


Learning to drive smoothly in minutes
-------------------------------------

Implementation of reinforcement learning approach to make a car learn to drive smoothly in minutes.
Uses SAC on VAE features.

| Author: Antonin Raffin (@araffin)
| Blog post: https://towardsdatascience.com/learning-to-drive-smoothly-in-minutes-450a7cdb35f4
| Github repo: https://github.com/araffin/learning-to-drive-in-5-minutes


Making Roboy move with elegance
-------------------------------

Project around Roboy, a tendon-driven robot, that enabled it to move its shoulder in simulation to reach a pre-defined point in 3D space. The agent used Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) or Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) and was tested on the real hardware.
